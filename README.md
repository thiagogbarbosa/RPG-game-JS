# Simple RPG Project

## Description
This project is a simple role-playing game (RPG) developed to achieve certification in JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms by Freecodecamp.org. It implements fundamental JavaScript concepts to create an interactive game environment.
You can play it [here](https://thiagogbarbosa.github.io/RPG-game-JS/).

## Key Features
- The player can navigate through different locations such as the town square, store, and cave.
- Players can buy health potions and weapons from the store using gold.
- Combat mechanics allow players to fight various monsters with different levels and health points.
- Players can attack, dodge, or run during combat.
- Winning battles rewards players with experience points and gold.
- There's an easter egg mini-game where players can guess a number to win gold or lose health.

## Future features
- Implement a visual weapon purchasing system to improve the buying and selling experience in the game.
- Expand the game world by adding different locations for the player to explore.

## Development Experience
This project was incredibly enjoyable to develop. It provided me with an opportunity to hone my skills in logic, algorithms, and creativity. Additionally, tackling the visual aspects posed a rewarding challenge. I'm eagerly looking forward to further refining and enhancing this project as my knowledge continues to grow.
